Restful API
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol. It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. REST was first introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000.

A REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources using HTTP protocol. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs. REST uses various representation to represent a resource like text, JSON, XML but JSON is the most popular one.

HTTP methods
Following four HTTP methods are commonly used in REST based architecture.

GET − This is used to provide a read only access to a resource.

PUT − This is used to create a new resource.

DELETE − This is used to remove a resource.

POST − This is used to update a existing resource or create a new resource.
